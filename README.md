# Decay For Github

Decay now ported as a github theme!

![preview](./assets/preview.png)

## Installation

First look up at [src](./src) and download the .css file of the decay version that you want to use
on your github, select either:

- decayce
- decay
- dark decay
- light decay

then, as I already mentioned, download that file.

Then download an extension that allows you to upload custom css
for a specific page (like github), you can use stylus or something,
but I prefer to use Refined Github:

- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/refined-github-/)
- [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/refined-github/hlepfoohegkhhmjieoechaddaejaokhf)

Then just search for the Refined Github preferences in your browser, and search the text area
that allows you to put custom css for github, inside that text area, put the content
of the downloaded file from this repo.

## Enjoy

That's all, if you like this theme, remember to smash the button :>
